# We trigger releases manually
on:

    # using `workflow_dispatch`, but that would only work from the master branch:
    # The workflow file must be committed in the default branch (master/main) if you want to
    # use the workflow_dispatch event.
    # https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25219#discussioncomment-3246909
    # So we use `push` for now should undo this once everything has been found to work.
